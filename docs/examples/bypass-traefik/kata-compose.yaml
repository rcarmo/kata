# Static site without Traefik (direct host exposure)
# - Serves files directly from /app (mount your site there; ensure /app/index.html exists)
# - Uses BusyBox httpd via the built-in `static` runtime
# - Publishes a host port instead of relying on Traefik; good for local or isolated use

environment:
  PORT: "8000"
  DOCROOT: "/app"

traefik: {}  # disable Traefik injection entirely

services:
  site:
    runtime: static
    environment:
      PORT: "${PORT}"
      DOCROOT: "${DOCROOT}"
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"   # change the left side if you need a different host port
    # If you prefer host networking instead of a published port, use the line below instead of ports:
    # network_mode: host
